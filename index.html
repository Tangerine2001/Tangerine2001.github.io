            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my homepage where I discuss and present my projects to the
                public for informational purposes. At the time of writing this, I am
                a sophomore at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a specific
                interest in Artificial Intelligence and how to incorporate that into
                something I do almost every day, playing video games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I am a CS Professional Services Intern at ADVA Optical
                Networking. This is my first professional career, and I am always on
                the lookout for more opportunities to further my career.
                <br>
                <br>
